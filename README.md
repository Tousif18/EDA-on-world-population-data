Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

---

## Quick summary
- **Project:** EDA on world population data (2001â€“2022)
- - **Notebook:** [Prodigy_Infotech_Task_1.ipynb](Prodigy_Infotech_Task_1.ipynb)
- **Dataset:** [world_population.csv](worldpopulationdata.csv)
- **How to run:** create a venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then open the notebook with `jupyter notebook`.
- **What I did (short):**
  - Basic cleaning (missing / duplicates handling)
  - Exploratory visualisations (bar charts, stacked charts)
  - Saved conclusions about population distribution and trends

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/Tousif18/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv">world_population_dataset</a>. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualisation



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualisation**: Created a bar chart and, stacked chart to visualise the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 



## Conclusion

In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
